# MissionComplete: Lumon Task Network

> "Your directives are clear. Your purpose is defined. Efficiency is its own reward."

## Overview
MissionComplete: Lumon Task Network is a **corporate-grade task management system** inspired by the **Severance** universe.

Every directive issued contributes to the greater purpose of **organizational success.**

You are not simply managing tasks. You are **fulfilling directives.**

## System Features
âœ… **Directive Management** â€“ Assign, update, and complete directives with absolute precision. Noncompliance is inadvisable.
âœ… **Performance Reports** â€“ Track efficiency ratings, analyze productivity trends, and receive real-time feedback.
âœ… **Corporate Wellness Program** â€“ Maintain optimal cognitive function via a strictly regulated break system.
âœ… **Efficiency Recognition** â€“ Performance is observed. Recognition is controlled. Appreciation must be earned.
âœ… **Surveillance-Grade UX** â€“ A seamless, eerie, corporate aesthetic ensures an immersive experience.
